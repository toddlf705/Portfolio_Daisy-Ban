            <div class='slide-right' id='intro-p'> Iâ€™m a Full Stack Software Engineer who finds an elevated interest in developing softwares. My background is in the entertainment field and a little bit of accounting. As a Spotify artist and a dance instructor, I enjoyed working with a team of  creative minds. The whole process  of creating and fabricating nothing into something is very powerful and intriguing. I want to bring my creativity into the logical world of front-end software engineering as well as my past accounting experiences into debugging and backend world.</div>
